# youtube-sentiment-pyspark

A PySpark-based sentiment and hate speech analysis system for YouTube comments. Collects data using the YouTube Data API and performs text cleaning and preprocessing. Implements ML pipelines with TF-IDF and Random Forest for classification. Handles class imbalance using class weights for improved accuracy.

## üß† Project Overview

This project focuses on:  
- Collecting and analyzing YouTube comments using Google‚Äôs YouTube API.  
- Cleaning text (removing emojis, punctuation, and noise).  
- Applying **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Random Forest** in a PySpark ML pipeline.  
- Handling **class imbalance** using **class weights**.  
- Supporting **scalable and distributed data processing** using Apache Spark.

## üìä Dataset

This project uses the **Davidson Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset**, which contains around **24,000 labeled tweets** categorized as:
- **0 ‚Üí Hate Speech**
- **1 ‚Üí Offensive Language**
- **2 ‚Üí Neither (Neutral)**
